Comments can be used to explain Python code.
Comments can be used to make the code more readable.

11,Python Variables,https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_variables.asp,"PythonVariables
Variables
Variables are containers for storing data values.
Creating Variables
Python has no command for declaring a variable.","x = 5y = ""John""print(x)print(y)
---
x = 4       # x is of type intx = ""Sally"" # x is now of type strprint(x)

13,Variable Names,https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_variables_names.asp,"Python -Variable Names
Variable Names
A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume).
Rules for Python variables:
Example","myvar = ""John""my_var = ""John""_my_var = ""John""myVar = ""John""MYVAR = ""John""myvar2 = ""John""

2myvar = ""John""my-var = ""John""my var = ""John""",Python Básico
14,Assign Multiple Values,https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_variables_multiple.asp,"Python Variables -Assign Multiple Values
Many Values to Multiple Variables
Python allows you to assign values to multiple variables in one line:
Example
Note:Make sure the number of variables matches the number of values, or else you will get an error.","x, y, z = ""Orange"", ""Banana"", ""Cherry""print(x)print(y)print(z)
---
x = y = z = ""Orange""print(x)print(y)print(z)

15,Output Variables,https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_variables_output.asp,"Python -Output Variables
Output Variables
Theprint()function is often used to output variables.
Example
In theprint()function, you output multiple 
variables, separated by a comma:","x = ""Python is awesome""print(x)
---
x = ""Python""y = ""is""z = ""awesome""print(x, y, z)
---
x = ""Python ""y = ""is ""z = ""awesome""print(x 
  + y + z)",Python Básico

Global Variables
Variables that are created outside of a function (as in all of the examples 
in the previous pages) are known as global variables.
Global variables can be used by everyone, both inside of 
functions and outside.
Example","x = ""awesome""def myfunc():print(""Python is "" + x)myfunc()
---
x = ""awesome""def myfunc():x = ""fantastic""print(""Python is "" + x)myfunc()print(""Python is "" + x)
---

18,Python Data Types,https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_datatypes.asp,"PythonData Types
Built-in Data Types
In programming, data type is an important concept.
Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do 
different things.
Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:",x = 5print(type(x)),Python Básico
19,Python Numbers,https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_numbers.asp,"PythonNumbers
Python Numbers
There are three numeric types in Python:
Variables of numeric types are created when you assign a value to them:
Example","x = 1    
  # inty = 2.8  # floatz = 1j   # complex
---
print(type(x))print(type(y))print(type(z))
---
x = 1y = 35656222554887711z = 
  -3255522print(type(x))print(type(y))print(type(z))",Python Básico
20,Python Casting,https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_casting.asp,"PythonCasting
Specify a Variable Type
There may be times when you want to specify a type on to a variable. This can be done with casting. Python is an object-orientated language, and as such it uses classes to define data types, including its primitive types.
Casting in python is therefore done using constructor functions:
Example","x = int(1)   # x will be 1y = int(2.8) # y will be 2z = int(""3"") # z will be 3
---
x = float(1)     # x will be 1.0y = float(2.8)   # y will be 2.8z = float(""3"")   # z will be 3.0w = float(""4.2"") # w will be 4.2
---
x = str(""s1"") # x will be 's1'y = str(2)    # y will be '2'z = str(3.0)  # z will be '3.0'",Python Básico
