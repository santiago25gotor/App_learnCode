20,Python Casting,https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_casting.asp,"PythonCasting
Specify a Variable Type
There may be times when you want to specify a type on to a variable. This can be done with casting. Python is an object-orientated language, and as such it uses classes to define data types, including its primitive types.
Casting in python is therefore done using constructor functions:
Example","x = int(1)   # x will be 1y = int(2.8) # y will be 2z = int(""3"") # z will be 3
---
x = float(1)     # x will be 1.0y = float(2.8)   # y will be 2.8z = float(""3"")   # z will be 3.0w = float(""4.2"") # w will be 4.2

Tuple is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of 
data, the other 3 areList,Set, andDictionary, all with different qualities and usage.
A tuple is a collection which is ordered andunchangeable.","thistuple = (""apple"", ""banana"", ""cherry"")print(thistuple)

Access Tuple Items
You can access tuple items by referring to the index number, inside square 
brackets:
Example
Print the second item in the tuple:","thistuple = (""apple"", ""banana"", ""cherry"")print(thistuple[1])
---
thistuple = (""apple"", ""banana"", ""cherry"")print(thistuple[-1])

Tuples are unchangeable, meaning that you cannot change, add, or remove items once the tuple is created.
But there are some workarounds.
Change Tuple Values
Once a tuple is created, you cannot change its values. Tuples areunchangeable, 
orimmutableas it also is called.","x = (""apple"", ""banana"", ""cherry"")y = list(x)y[1] = ""kiwi""x = 
  tuple(y)print(x)

Unpacking a Tuple
When we create a tuple, we normally assign values to it. This is called ""packing"" a tuple:

As the name suggests, Quicksort is one of the fastest sorting algorithms.
The Quicksort algorithm takes an array of values, chooses one of the values as the 'pivot' element, and moves the other values so that lower values are on the left of the pivot element, and higher values are on the right of it.
In this tutorial the last element of the array is chosen to be the pivot element, but we could also have chosen the first element of the array, or any element in th","[ 11, 9, 12, 7, 3]
