Strings
Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.
'hello'is the same as""hello"".
You can display a string literal with theprint()function:","print(""Hello"")print('Hello')

23,Slicing Strings,https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_strings_slicing.asp,"Python -Slicing Strings
Slicing
You can return a range of characters by using the slice syntax.
Specify the start index and the end index, separated by a colon, to return a 
part of the string.

---
b = ""Hello, World!""print(b[:5])

An example of an illegal character is a double quote inside a string that is surrounded by double quotes:","txt = ""We are the so-called ""Vikings"" from the north.""
---
txt = ""We are the so-called \""Vikings\"" from the north.""",Python Intermedio
